# 🌱 Practice Projects

Welcome to this repository — a collection of practice projects built while learning and exploring different areas of Java development.

This space is not about perfect code. It’s about:
- **Breaking things** to learn how they work  
- **Building simple things** to understand bigger concepts  
- **Practicing daily** to turn confusion into clarity  

Each folder here represents a lesson learned — whether it’s a REST API, a servlet, or a simple controller — the goal is the same: **learn by doing**.

### 🔁 Why this repo exists:
- Reinforce Java and OOP fundamentals  
- Build CRUD operations using Spring Boot  
- Understand MVC architecture, annotations, dependency injection  
- Practice designing and testing REST APIs  
- Learn the structure of real-world backend apps
- To get hands-on with Spring Boot annotations, workflows, and configurations  
- To build the muscle memory for solving real backend problems  
- To keep track of progress, mistakes, and improvements over time

### 🚧 Note:
These are not polished production-grade apps. They are **learning checkpoints**.
